What is VPC ?
ans;-VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud, and it is a fundamental component of Amazon Web Services (AWS). A VPC allows you to create
a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch and run resources in a virtual network that you define. It provides 
a way to customize your network configuration, such as IP address ranges, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
=====================================================================================================================================
What are the Subnets when working with VPC ?
ans;-Each VPC network consists of one or more IP address ranges called subnets. Subnets are regional resources, and have IP address
ranges associated 
===================================================================================================================================
What is NAT Device ?
ans NAT  device is a networking device that performs Network Address Translation. NAT is a technique used to modify network address information
in packet headers while in transit, typically in routers or firewalls. The primary purpose of a NAT device is to allow multiple devices within
a private network to share a single public IP address for connecting to the internet.
========================================================================================================================================
What is the difference between stateful & stateless filtering ?
ans;-
1.Filtering decision Based on information in packet headers
2.Memory and CPU intensive low
3.stateful security is low
4.performanace is fast 
---stateless filtering-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Filtering decision Based on flows
2.Memory and CPU intensive high
3.stateful security is high
4.performanace is low
=======================================================================================================================================
What are the advantages of using default VPC ?
ans;-
1.Internet access
A default VPC includes internet access by default, along with an internet gateway and public subnets with corresponding route tables.
This is not available by default in non-default VPCs.
2.IPv4 CIDR block
All default VPCs are associated with an IPv4 CIDR block with a 172.31.0.0/16 address range. This gives you 65,536 possible IP addresses, 
minus some AWS reserved addresses.
3.Public IPv4 addresses
In a default VPC, servers within the public subnet are assigned a public IP address. This allows servers to reach the outside internet,
and the outside internet to reach the servers
=================================================================================================================================
What is the internet gateway in VPC ?
ans;- internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and 
the internet
===================================================================================================================================
What is Network ACL in VPC ?
ans;-A network access control list (ACL) allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level.
=======================================================================================================================================
What is the Security Group in VPC ?
ans;-a Security Group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for instances (virtual machines) within a VPC. 
Security Groups act as a fundamental component of the network security model in AWS, allowing you to define rules that determine
what kind of traffic is allowed or denied to and from instances.
=================================================================================================================================
What 1>.is an Elastic IP Address in VPC, and why do we need to use, realtime example ?
ans;-VPC is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is associated with your AWS account, allowing you to allocate
it to instances within a VPC. Elastic IP addresses are particularly useful when you need a consistent public IP address for your
instance
2>.elastic ip uses- 1.Static IP Address 2.Avoiding IP Address Changes 3.Disaster Recovery and Redundancy 4.Portability and Reusability
3>. realtime elastic ip example in ;- web server running on an EC2 instance in your VPC, and you want to host a website with a consistent public IP address
