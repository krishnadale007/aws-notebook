what is ec2 ?
ans;-
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. EC2 is an on-demand computing service on the AWS cloud platform. 
Under computing, it includes all the services a computing device can offer to you along with the flexibility
of a virtual environment. It also allows the user to configure their instances as per their requirements i.e.
allocate the RAM, ROM, and storage according to the need of the current task. Even the user can dismantle 
the virtual device once its task is completed and it is no more required. For providing, all these
scalable resources AWS charges some bill amount at the end of every month, the bill amount is entirely dependent on your usage.
EC2 allows you to rent virtual computers. The provision of servers on AWS Cloud is one of the easiest ways in EC2. 
EC2 has resizable capacity. EC2 offers security, reliability, high performance, and cost-effective infrastructure so as to meet the demanding business needs.

Why do we need EC2 service in cloud computing ?
ans;-
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.
Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

Features of Amazon EC2 ?
ans;-
Amazon EC2 provides the broadest and deepest instance choice to match your workloadâ€™s needs. General purpose, compute optimized, 
memory optimized, storage optimized, and accelerated computing instance types are available that provide the optimal compute, memory,
storage, and networking balance for your workloads. Processors from Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and AWS power these instance types and provide
additional performance and cost optimizations. Local storage and enhanced networking options available with instance types further help
optimize performance for workloads that are disk or network I/O bound. Many instance types also offer bare metal instances that
provide your applications with direct access to the processor and memory of the underlying server for running in non-virtualized 
environments or for applications where you want to use your own hypervisor. To find the right instance for your workload, 
visit the EC2 instance types page. You can also use the AWS Compute Optimizer to get recommendations on optimal AWS Compute resources 
for your workloads to reduce costs and improve performance.

What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
ans;-
Hyper visor is a firmware or low level program that acts as a virtual machine manager. A system on which hypervisor
is running one or more virtual machines is known as host machine. Each virtual machine is called guest machine. One can classify
hypervisor into two categories :
1. Type 1 / native / Bare-Metal
2.Type 2 / Hosted
======================================================================================================================================
Where we use hypervisor ?
ans;-
A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine. Every virtual machine
has its own operating system and applications. The hypervisor allocates the underlying physical computing resources such as 
CPU and memory to individual virtual machinesas required.

EC2 Instance state ?
ans;= 1> 2/2 =helthey   2> 1/2 =software error    3> 0/1=hardware error 
=====================================================================================================================================
How many types of EC2 Instance-State codes ?
ans;-
0: pending
16: running
32: shutting-down
48: terminated
64: stopping
80: stopped
===============================================================================================================================
What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ?
ans;=
In computing, hibernation is a power-saving mode that saves the current state of a computer's system to the hard drive before
shutting down. It's also known as "suspend to disk" or "Safe Sleep" on Macintosh computers. 
Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged. Hibernation is a means of avoiding
the burden of saving unsaved data before shutting down and restoring all running programs and re-opening documents and browser tabs.
